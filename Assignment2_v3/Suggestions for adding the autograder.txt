Follow these steps if you have already started implementing

- Make a copy of your folder in case there is a problem!
- You can copy over everything from the new given folder to the old given folder
- Copy over the autograder folder to under src
- VERY IMPORTANT: Change the visibility of the nested Coordinate class to public in Maze.java
- Note that you need to run the main under the Autograde.java!
